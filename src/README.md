## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister from an activity                                      |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

## In-Memory Storage

**All activity and participant data is stored in-memory without any persistent database.**

This means:
- Data is stored in a Python dictionary during runtime
- Changes (signups, unregistrations) are immediately reflected
- All data is lost when the server restarts
- No database setup or configuration is required
- Perfect for development and demonstration purposes

This design choice makes the application simple to run and maintain without the overhead of database management.
